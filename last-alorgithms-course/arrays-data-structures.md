# Arrays - Data Structures

If const `a =[]` is not array, then what is it?

## What is an array?

Continuous memory space that stores that memory as a specific type.

## Constant time operations

- Accessing an element
- Setting an element
- Finding the length of the array

How this works?

- The memory address of the first element is known
- The memory address of the next element is calculated by adding the size of the
element to the memory address of the first element

## Overview

- They are fixed size, contiguous memory chunks
- That means you cannot grow it
- There is no "insertAt" or push or pop. Doesn't mean you can't write those though
