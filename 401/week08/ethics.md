# Ethics

## The code I'm still ashamed of

I read `The code I'm still ashmaed of` and this was a heartbreaking story. It is
wild to think of how many companies have this kind of culture. It is especially
difficult when it comes to health care. It is so immoral and irresponsible to
prioritize profit over people's lives. I think that the author did the right
thing by leaving the company. I think that it is important to stand up for what
is right and to not be afraid to speak up when you see something wrong.

## Self Driving Car Ethics

This one is interesting because it always brings up very difficult scenarios. I
find that these types of arguments are real and valid and worth discussing. However
I think the point of self driving cars is to make the roads safer, which was would
happen. Yes there are scenarios worth figuring out, but those scenarios in my mind,
shouldn't stop the progress of self driving cars.
