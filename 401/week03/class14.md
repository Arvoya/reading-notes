# Event Driven Architecture

1. Discuss 2 possible project ideas that could be completed by you and a partner
in the alloted time.
    I worked on this project with John. We came up with this idea of doing a security
    system that would allow `hackerman` to enter a buildings system. The security
    feature would track hacker man and send an event out to everyone else informing
    them of his presence. As hacker man moves through the building, he would make
    his way to the HR department where HR could emit a message to security to kick
    him out.
    I forget the other idea we had, but another way to implement this would be
    to have a game of sorts tied with a chat application. The chat application
    would be the way to communicate with the game.
