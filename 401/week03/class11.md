# Event Driven Applications

## Questions & Answers

[Event Driven Programming](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/nodejs-event-driven-programming)

1. What native Node.js module allows us to get started with Event Driven Programming?
`events` module
2. What is the value of Object Oriented Programming used in tandem with Event Driven
Programming?
    > The Object Oriented approach promotes the idea that all behavior of an individual
unit (or `object`) be handled from code within that unit.
3. Consider your knowledge of Event Driven Programming in the Web Browser, now explain
to a non-technical friend how Event Driven Programming might be useful on the backend
using Node.js.
It's useful on the backend, because more javascript code is being run on the server.
This allows for more control and the ability to share `shared state` between different
users. This is useful for things like chat applications, where multiple users need
to see the same information in real time.

## Additional Questions

1. Looking ahead at this module's [course schedule](https://codefellows.github.io/code-401-javascript-guide/curriculum/#module-3),
What do you look forward to learning?
I am excited for all of it haha I have been loooking at various positions, and
I see I'm missing some valuable skills. Currently I have been seeing a lot of AWS,
so I am excited to learn more about that. I also see some mobile development, so
React Native is something I am excited to learn about as well.
2. What are your learning goals after reading and reviewing the [class README](https://codefellows.github.io/code-401-javascript-guide/curriculum/class-11/)?
Learn how `events` work in the backend using Node.js. I understand them in the context
of the browser, but I am excited to see how they work on the server side.
