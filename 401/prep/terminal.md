# Working with terminal

Overall I learned that is way more to the terminal than I initially thought. I think
most of the commands are pretty intuitive and easy to remember. I think the hardest
will be remembered the really specific commands and the flags that go with them.
It'll make more sense the more I find myself needing to use them.

## Commands

* `pwd` - print working directory
* `ls` - list files in current directory
* `cd` - change directory
* `touch` - create a new file
* `mkdir` - create a new directory
* `rm` - remove a file
* `rmdir` - remove a directory
* `cp` - copy a file
* `mv` - move a file
* `file` - determine file type
* `man` - display manual page for a command
* `man -k` - search manual pages for a keyword
