### Prompt: Explain Growth Mindset

In reading the recommended blog on [Growth Mindset](https://www.atlassian.com/blog/inside-atlassian/growth-mindset), I learned that it is understood to be a love for learning. I am delighted to express this mindset in my life and excited to continuously develop this skill. With close friends, I like to say I'm a student for life and a student of life. My background is in the study of life known as Ayurveda, and a 'Growth Mindset' is something Ayurveda would also acknowledge as an important way of conducting oneself if one seeks personal fulfillment in any subject. In my studies the qualities and attributes of a growth mindset fall into the understanding that having a growth mindset is a natural fruit or concequence of what it means to be a healthy person. Ayurveda recommends that a person's senses be tuned toward truth and observing any situation with as much clarity as possible. By doing so, one has the ability to change their life by cultivating their body and mind to be in harmony with the world in the most authentic way possible.

A growth mindset involves taking ownership and responsibility for ones action in response to any obstacle outside of our control. While I may not know everything and may not always be in the best situations, it is within my control alone to take action that will lead to the growth and understanding that I seek. It consists of a collection of small acts and behaviors that one undergoes in an attempt to experience understanding.
