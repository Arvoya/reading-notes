## Module 102
### Prompt: Explain Growth Mindset
In reading the recommended blog on [Growth Mindset](https://www.atlassian.com/blog/inside-atlassian/growth-mindset), I learned that it is understood to be a love for learning. I am delighted to express this mindset in my life and excited to continuously develop this skill. With close friends, I like to say I'm a student for life and a student of life. My background is in the study of life known as Ayurveda, and a 'Growth Mindset' is something Ayurveda would also acknowledge as an important way of conducting oneself if one seeks personal fulfillment in any subject.

A Growth Mindset involves taking ownership and responsibility for ones action in response to any obstacle outside of our control. While I may not know everything and may not always be in the best situations, it is within my control alone to take action that will lead to the growth and understanding that I seek. It consists of a collection of small acts and behaviors that one undergoes in an attempt to experience understanding.

**Tips to remember:**
 - Develop and maintain a daily routine
 - Healthy sleep schedule is crucial
 - Spend time with family and friends
 - Take breaks
 - Eat healthy meals
