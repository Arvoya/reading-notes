1. To what extent did psychological safety impact your previous work experience? I've had my own unpleasant experiences in jobs due to a lack of psychological safety. It was mostly in food jobs, where the manager wasn't really adept or interested in getting to know the other employees. Lots of drama, lots of talk behind peoples back. That type of behavior is really sad to see, and although I've read this article its good to go back every now and then and remember the importance of psychological safety and how it affects all work environments.
2. How does this article inform your approach to working with others moving forward?

1. Who is Roy Fielding? A smart guy who did a bunch of research explaining how the web works, and helped write HTTP.
2. Why don't the techniques that we use in this class work well when we need to be able to talk to all of the machines in the world? Because machines don't care about formatting, layout, design, etc. They just need to GET, POST, PUT, or PATCH certain types of data.
3. What is the HTTP protocol that Fielding and his friends created? It makes it capable of describing the location of of something anywhere in the world from anywhere in the world.
4. Who does a `GET` do? Retrieves information.
5. What does a `POST` do? Add data to another system.
6. What does `PUT` do? Replace something in another system.
7. What does `PATCH` do? Partial update.
