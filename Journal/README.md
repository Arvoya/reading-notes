# Personal Journal

Throughout my time at Code Fellows, you will read about my thoughts, feelings, and experiences. I want to do this for a couple of reasons. Firstly, there are certain goals I'm looking to achieve, and I'm simply curious to see if reflecting back could be useful. While I'm not sure if I will personally revisit these reflections with a specific purpose in mind, I have discovered that maintaining a loose form of journaling generally contributes to a peaceful state of mind.
