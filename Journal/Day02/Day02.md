I'm both tired and increasingly curious. I enjoyed the lectures, although I think HTML looks like alphabet soup. I feel inspired, and my mind is bubbling up with various ideas on how software development is about creating things for people to use. It's like art but with function and movement â€“ art that requires engagement for it to be understood. I hope I can connect with this viewpoint or similar ones as I progress through the course. Without creativity, I can see why coding can be viewed as mundane and gray. However, the more I understand how these things work, the more my mind expands into coming up with things that inspire me, and I'd want people to interact with them.

On a random side note, tomorrow is CSS day, and multiple people have warned me of its troublesome nature. Heres to a full night's rest to tackle the beast.
