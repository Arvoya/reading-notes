First day into the next big Module! I'm really excited to get going into creating awesome things! Most of the first class felt like review and the second started to get things going with new files like 'gitignore' and 'eslintrc.json' which I'm looking forward to understanding as time goes on. Goal for this week is to get better sleep and make sure I'm moving my body a little more.
