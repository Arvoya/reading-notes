# Journal Day03

Went over the lab and learned a couple different ways to build various loops. Most of my learning was from the reading material today. The last two days I decided to read the blogs once without taking notes, then go back and taking notes on the new things I learned within the article or if they are related to assigned questions to answer. It's been more enjoyable to go into the blog with a lighter curiosity. I'm planning to do a bit of the lecture five reading notes in hopes tomorrow is more of a lab day. Then by this Friday I can get started on the second week!
