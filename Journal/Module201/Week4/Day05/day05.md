So it has been a while! Took a two-week vacation to Mexico and that was fantastic. I'm back and ready to code. Today was all about preparations for the final project for Module 201. I'm super excited to get things going, and I'm happy with the project idea. I had to do some research to see if some features are possible, and I'm already noticing how much I may have to pivot for the sake of time and also scope of my current skill set. That isn't so much a set back as it is understanding the flow of projects and how things change and adapt wherever necessary.
