Today was all about forms and events. It's cool to learn about the many ways users can interact with a webpage, and something as simple as a form can be exactly what a business or product needs to function. I'm excited to learn more about the backend of web development as well as security and how information is stored. The mountain of coding is a big one, and I'm sure I'll be climbing it for the rest of my life, but it feels good to have the energy to keep the climb going. Some days are slower, and I stop to appreciate the scenery, and others it feels like a dangerous path filled with fear of not understanding, but with enough time I make it to a patch of flat land to rest.
