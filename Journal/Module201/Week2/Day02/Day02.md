Pretty good day overall. Did manage to get more sleep, so that was a plus. I feel like I'm both learning a lot and no idea if I'm actually retaining anything. I think there are something's I of course remember, but I can tell if I don't continue to practice, it can quickly fade away. It's mostly small things like remembering CSS rules, or HTML semantics. It's probably because we spend a lot more time with JavaScript than anything else.
