Long day from a long weekend. Had a bit of a slow start in the morning due to some unrelated events, but ended up finally finishing everything. I learned a lot, objects are pretty neat and got to play around with CSS a bit more which was cool. Super tired, hope to catch up on sleep tonight, also lots of fires here in Seattle :c
