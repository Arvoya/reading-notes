# Journal Day03

Learned all about Flexbox today! I'm glad the course cycles through JS concepts and then CSS. It gives my brain time to reflect and digest the previous day's material. I don't think I particularly like CSS, but I appreciate learning it. So many little ways it can go wrong, and that can be frustrating, but once I get it working I see how I was just stuck and missing the bigger picture. I'm enjoying the process overall, and glad this week doesn't feel as exhausting as the last. Hope I keep the momentum!
