# Journal Day02

8:03pm

Today was a chill day! The lab I had was a little more difficult and ran into some issues, but I solved the issue a lot faster than I thought I would. I'm calling it early today in an attempt to make 7-8:30pm my hours when I unplug from my computer and enjoy the sunset. At first my thought process was, if I have energy, then I'm working on these classes. However, that is not the healthiest approach to work, so I'm shifting gears down and making sure I take time for me. Looking forward to tomorrow!
