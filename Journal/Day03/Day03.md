Well, I'm chugging away! I'm crafting the first website as assigned by the class. I'm loving the quirky ideas I'm coming up with, and they're leading me down a rabbit hole of acquiring new knowledge. The class covers all the basics, making it a perfect introduction to the realm of software development. The responsibility to learn and digest these topics is up to me, especially during the intervals between modules. However, I'm a hopeful dude!

I was stuck on a particular problem for over three hours, and then out of the blue, I managed to figure it out. That sense of accomplishment was amazing. I'm staying up quite late, but I did allow myself a bit more sleep this morning.

Looking forward to what tomorrow holds.
