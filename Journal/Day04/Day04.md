It's late, and my brain has melted. I'm still super pumped and proud of all the work I've been doing. The teacher and TAs have been amazing today. I've run into a lot of issues with my ambitious desires to make my website do complicated things. Sometimes I don't know when to stop, but at the very least, the staff is super supportive, and I appreciate that. It looks like I should be able to finish everything up by tomorrow, and that is the current goal!

If I do, hopefully, I can quickly get started on Module 201 of the curriculum. If not, then there are plenty of tools online that I can spend some time on. That or work on personal projects! It's been one heck of a week, and I hope I can retain all the information I've been exposed to! So far, so good, but definitely excited for the weekend to take some R & R.

Hasta ma√±ana!
