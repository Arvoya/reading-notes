# Sketching

2 steps to sketching:

1. Idea generation
    1. It's about getting ideas out quickly, generate as many approaches then decide
2. Detail refinement
    1. It's about refining the details of the idea, make it more concrete
    2. It's okay to kill idea's that don't work

## Idea generation

Initial sketches you create with lower level deatils, no colors, maybe some to signify
key parts of the sketch. Generate as many options as you can.

## Detail refinement

Then you can add some wireframes, buttons, inputs, thinking about interaction.
Then you can refine sketches and pull out elements that really needed, building
components.

## Sketching Process

**Step 1 - Be Prepared:**

* Have a sketchbook, pen, pencil, eraser, ruler, and a sharpie
(whatever tools you need)
* Have a list of things you want to sketch
* Have a timer
* Have a space to sketch
* Goals
  * Certain flow
  * Certain interaction
* Who is your audience?
  * Who are you sketching for? (client wise)
  * What are you trying to communicate?
* Timebox yourself
  * don't get bogged down on details

**Step 2 - Get Started:**

* Draw a frame for your device
  * Browser
  * Mobile
  * Tablet
* Start with simple and redundant elements (element you will see a lot of)
  * Header
  * Footer
  * Navigation
  * Content
* Detail interactions
  * Simple shapes
* Annotate and document
  * You want to be able to undertand what you were drawing later
  * Explain reasoning behind certain elements
  * Gives context
* Keep it going
  * Share your sketches
  * Get feedback
  * Talk to everyone
  * Build off of that feedback

**Step 3 - Refinement:**

* Add titles to your sketches
  * really helps understand which screens are relevant
* Annotate again
  * Little notes explaining purpose of certain elements
* Use numbers
  * Helps with flow and feedback
* Use arrows
  * Helps with flow as well
* Draw gestures for interactions
  * Helps with understanding how the user will interact with the design
  * Can be difficult and challenging
  * Have a conversation with developers

## Sketching User Flows

What to ask yourself:

1. What do I need to draw?
2. Define a starting point on the user's journery
    1. This can be the User's experience of what they get out of it
    2. This can be the steps users have to take to get to the end goal
        1. Page Hierarchies
        2. Navigation
3. Decide your next steps
    1. Which way will this step lead users?
    2. Where do you want them to go?
    3. What do they need to do to get there?
    4. If they exit, where will they go?

## Tips

* Don't worry about being messy
* Takes practice
