## Notes

Here are the notes Iâ€™ve taken while reading the following blogs:

[HTML Text Fundamentals](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML/HTML_text_fundamentals) \| [HTML Advanced Text Formatting](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML/Advanced_text_formatting) \|[How CSS is structured](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/First_steps/How_CSS_is_structured)

## Advanced text formatting

### Superscript and subscript

Superscript - `<sup>` \| used for mathematical equations or dates of the year.

Subscript - `<sub>` \| used for chemical formulae

### Abbreviations

`<abbr>` - used to wrap around the abbreviation or acronym. Use the attribute `<title>` to prove the full expansion of the term.
