3. Provide an example of when the `figures` element would be useful in an HTML document. When you want to have an image have a caption. Or when you want the space that the image will take be loaded up, so it isn't as jarring for the viewer/user.
4. Describe the difference between a `gif` image and an `svg` image pretend you are explaining to an elder in your community. You know how your phone or computer can show you different images? Some of them are small, some of them are large. Some can look really clear and others you start seeing various boxes of color. All of these images can be of a different type. `gif` is one of those types, and it only uses 250 colors. `svg` is another type, but those are mostly the shapes and logos, and no matter how big or how small you zoom in or out. It will always keep its high quality and crisp image.

### CSS

1. Describe the difference between foreground and background colors of an HTML element, pretend you are talking to someone with no technical knowledge. When you look at a website. Sometimes you can see that the background of the website is white or black or any color. This is the background colors of the `<body>` element. Elements are basically boxes and a website is boxes inside of boxes. Or boxes next to boxes. Each box can have a background. And the content inside each box can have its own color making it the foreground.
2. Your friend asks you to give his colorless blog website a touch up. How would you use color to give his blog some character? I'd ask for the tone and feel they want their website to be. Are they looking for dark and serious, or colorful and playful? Do they want vibrant colors or colors that are easy on the eyes? I'd have to know much more detail.
3. What should you consider when choosing fonts for an HTML document? Understand the use of 'web-safe' fonts, and consider the professionalism you are looking for in a website.
4. What do `font-size`, `font-weight`, and `font-style` do to HTML text element? These properties change the font size, if its bold, or italicized.
5. Describe two ways you could add spacing around the characters displayed in an `h1` element. Use the `letter-spacing` or `word-spacing` CSS properties to change the spacing.
