## Understanding JS Canvas

`<canvas>` - is an HTML element that allows JavaScript to draw 2D graphics. It required 2 attributes: `width` & `height`.

``` HTML
<canvas width="500" height="300" id="canvas"></canvas>
```

Everything within the element `<canvas></canvas>` is used to display in situations where the canvas doesn't properly load. So the programer can leave information letting the user know.

`getContext()` - is a method in JavaScript used to return a context object. The parameter to create these objects is:

* `'2d'` - Which will give ways for drawing 2D shapes
