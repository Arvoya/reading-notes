## Understanding Flexbox

Flexbox is a layout model used in CSS. It allows the control of content in either the vertical or horizontal direction, making it 'one-dimensional'.

The main axis is the horizontal axis that goes from left to right.

The cross axis is the vertical axis that goes from top to bottom.

When someone uses flexbox to change the order of content in the way it was initially written with the HTML file, it can cause the screen reader to read the content different from how it was physically intended to be read.

When comparing Flexbox to Float, flexbox gives a lot more options in how you want the content to be displayed. Float is a bit singular while flexbox creates wider dimensions.
