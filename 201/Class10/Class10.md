## Questions and Answers

### JavaScript Troubleshooting

1. Name some key differences between a **Syntax Error** and a **Logic Error**. Biggest difference between syntax and logic, is that syntax is a form of spelling mistake created in the code. From forgetting a special character to actually misspelling a word. I have forgotten names of functions and or called the wrong function as well.
2. List a few types of errors that you have encountered in past lab assignments and explain how you were able to correct them. I have encountered multiple misspelled words in my code, as well as using brackets instead of parenthesis. Things of that sort. Some of the biggest errors was in the Salmon Cookies, messing up the syntax of CSS/HTML.
3. How will this topic continue to influence your long term goals? I'm excited to see how efficient it can make the process of building and debugging code.

### JavaScript Debugger

1. How would you describe the JavaScript Debugger tool and how it works to someone just starting out in software development? I would describe it as a tool that allows you to make breakpoints to check in on specific spots of your code.
2. Define what a breakpoint is. A breakpoint is the particular spot you have chosen to pause execution of code.
3. What is the call stack? Call stack section of the debugger shows you what code has been run through.

## Troubleshooting JS

### Types of Errors

1. **Syntax errors:** Spelling errors occurring with the text editor.
2. **Logic errors:** Code functions but not in the way intended.

## JavaScript Debugger

This debugger lives within the browser and allows you to check the value of variables and set breakpoints, which are places you want the program to pause execution and there you can see if the functions are working correctly in changing the values, or whatever it is you are looking for.
