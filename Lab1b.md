#### History 
Developed by [John Gruber](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/)
> "Markdown is a text-to-HTML conversion tool for web writers. Markdown allows you to write using an easy-to-read, easy-to-write plain text format, then convert it to structurally valid XHTML (or HTML)."

#### Process
You start by using an application or website that uses Markdown. This was written using GitHub. You will create a Markdown file and you will notice it ends with "**.md**" signifying that it is indeed a **M**ar**d**kown file. 

From within your application or website you can you preview what the text will turn into or have the ability to export to HTML or PDF depending on your usage or intended goal. Personally I will be using to take notes, log my thoughts and experiences of becoming software developer.
