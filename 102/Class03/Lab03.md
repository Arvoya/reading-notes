# Revisions & the Cloud

Lab03

## Reflections

This assignment was all about reorganizing the front page of this website and formatting it in a way that guides the user to explore my notebook. We learned about Git and the various commands that allow us to store the repository locally, make revisions, and then upload it back to the cloud, which in this case is GitHub!

I always wondered how people use GitHub, how multiple can work on the same file, or just how these things work. So this class was especially pleasent to go through.
